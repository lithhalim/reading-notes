<h2 align="center">Javascript ES6</h2>
##### Syntax


```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(name, year) {
    this.name = name;
    this.year = year;
  }
}
```

##### Using a Class

```javascript
let myCar1 = new Car("Ford", 2014);
let myCar2 = new Car("Audi", 2019);


```

##### Class Methods
Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.

Use the keyword class to create a class.

Always add a constructor() method.

Then add any number of methods.



<h2 align="center">Routing</h2>

A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

The following code is an example of routes that are defined for the GET and the POST methods to the root of the app.

```javascript
// GET method route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request to the homepage')
})

// POST method route
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request to the homepage')
})


```

<h2 align="center">Route handlers</h2>

You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks. You can use this mechanism to impose pre-conditions on a route, then pass control to subsequent routes if thereâ€™s no reason to proceed with the current route.

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both, as shown in the following examples.

A single callback function can handle a route. For example:

```javascript
// GET method route
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()

// middleware that is specific to this router
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time: ', Date.now())
  next()
})
// define the home page route
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Birds home page')
})
// define the about route
router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About birds')
})



```
