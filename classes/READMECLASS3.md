## Linked Lists


The linked list or one way list is a linear set of data elements which is also termed as nodes. Here, the linear order is specified using pointers.

Each node is separated into two different parts:


- The first part holds the information of the element or node

- The second piece contains the address of the next node (link / next-pointer field) in this structure list.


##### Linked lists can be measured as a form of high-level standpoint as being a series of nodes where each node has at least one single pointer to the next connected node, and in the case of the last node, a null pointer is used for representing that there will be no further nodes in the linked list. In the data structure, you will be implementing the linked lists which
 always maintain head and tail pointers for inserting values at either the head or tail of the list is a constant time operation. Randomly inserting of values is excluded using this concept and will follow a linear operation. As such, linked lists in data structure have some characteristics which are mentioned below:




##### Big O notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Big O is a member of a family of notations invented by Paul Bachmann,[1] Edmund Landau,[2] and others, collectively called Bachmann–Landau notation or asymptotic notation. The letter O was chosen by Bachmann to stand for Ordnung, meaning the order of approximation.

In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.[3] In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem. Big O notation is also used in many other fields to provide similar estimates.

Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation. The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the order of the function. A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function.

Associated with big O notation are several related notations, using the symbols o, Ω, ω, and Θ, to describe other kinds of bounds on asymptotic growth rates.
