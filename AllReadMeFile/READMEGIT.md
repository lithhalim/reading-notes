<h3 align="center"> Branching</h3>
Branches are an important part of working with Git. Any commits you make will be made on the branch you’re currently “checked out” to. Use git status to see which branch that is.

##### git branch [branch-name]

Creates a new branch

##### git switch -c [branch-name]

Switches to the specified branch and updates the working directory

##### git merge [branch]

Combines the specified branch’s history into the current branch. This is usually done in pull requests, but is an important Git operation.
##### git branch -d [branch-name]

Deletes the specified branch
<h3 align="center"> Synchronize changes</h3>

Synchronize your local repository with the remote repository on GitHub.com

#### git fetch

Downloads all history from the remote tracking branches

#### git merge

Combines remote tracking branches into current local branch

#### git push

Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

#### git pull

Updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on GitHub. git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge
